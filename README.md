## Opening book and training scripts for my lichess bot, TuroBot

This repo contains the Polyglot opening book (merged.bin) used by the TuroBot lichess bot.

Basically, the z3-GMopenings.bin book was manually tuned with Scid vs PC (resulting in z3mod.bin) and then merged with blunder.bin, which was created by automatic analysis of lost lichess games with Stockfish. (See how.txt for details on how the scripts were used.)
